# COMMIT-SHEET — <project>

> Six decisions before the first line of code. A generic answer ("modern, clean") means the decision hasn't been made — stop and make it. Filled example answers below each field: ✗ is what slop looks like, ✓ is the bar.

## 1. Peak / Signature
<!-- direct: the ONE wow moment. build: the one element a visitor describes to a friend. -->
…
> ✗ "beautiful animations throughout"
> ✓ "peak = scene 4: the espresso machine disassembles into 9 floating parts as you scroll (canvas sequence, 300vh pinned)"

## 2. Color
<!-- primary as OKLCH + tier (restrained / committed / full-palette / drenched) + why it's not lavender, not cream, not the category reflex -->
…
> ✗ "purple gradient, feels techy"
> ✓ "oklch(0.58 0.19 35) burnt terracotta, tier: committed (~40% of surface). Not the AI lavender; not wellness-beige — terracotta is pulled from the product's clay housing"

## 3. Type
<!-- display + text pair on a contrast axis + why not Inter -->
…
> ✗ "Inter for everything, it's readable"
> ✓ "display: Fraunces (soft wide serif, brand's warmth) / text: Söhne-class grotesque via 'Archivo'. Axis: high-contrast serif × neutral grotesque. Inter rejected as the 2024–26 default"

## 4. Grid break
<!-- the ONE concrete thing that breaks the symmetric grid -->
…
> ✗ "asymmetric layout"
> ✓ "product photo in S2 crosses into S3 over the section boundary (−120px overlap), text wraps around it via shape-outside"

## 5. Motion budget
<!-- ≤3 scroll-pattern families, named -->
…
> ✓ "(1) scrub-pinned hero, (2) per-word text reveals on headings, (3) depth parallax in proof section. Nothing else scroll-triggered"

## 6. Reflex check
<!-- (a) what a generic AI does for this category; (b) what a generic AI avoiding (a) does; (c) our argued deviation from both.
     If recon ran, (a) is evidence, not a guess — cite what design/refs/REFERENCES.md showed repeatedly. -->
a) …
b) …
c) …
> ✓ "a) coffee = warm beige + serif + steam photo; b) 'specialty' = black + neon + brutalist menu; c) ours = terracotta drench + technical cutaway drawings of the machine (the brand is engineering-led, not café-cozy)"
